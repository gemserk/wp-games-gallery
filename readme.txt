Requires at least: 3.1
Tested up to: 3.1.3
Stable tag: trunk

== Description ==

Create a gallery of games from your game pages metadata.

== Usage ===

To use the plugin you have to add the tag [create_games_gallery] to your page. This will generate a list of games based on the metadata of children pages of the current page.

For example, if you have a page "Games" and two children pages "Game1" and "Game2", then the plugin will get metadata for those two pages and generate the gallery in the page "Games".

Current supported metadata values available to use are:

- screenshot : a list of screenshots urls of your game. 
- description : an usually small description of your game.
